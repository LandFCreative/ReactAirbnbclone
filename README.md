<h2> My Professional Portfolio</h2>


<h3>Built with:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>React</li> 
</ul>


<b>What I learned:</b>

<ul>
  <li>Eventlisteners</li>
  <li>Using Components, State, Hooks</li>
  <li>Responsive Layouts</li>
</ul>

<b>Continued development</b>

<b>I'd like to:</b>

Make the code a bit dryer to reduce repetition; maybe try use REACT

Quick start:

```
$ yarn # npm install
$ yarn build # npm run build
````

## Development

Run Webpack in watch-mode to continually compile the JavaScript as you work:

```
$ yarn watch # npm run watch
```

Happy Coding!
